# cms-rrc-bot - monit configuration for cms-rrc-bot
#
# This ensures it stays running. It does not check for changes.
# Those changes must be pushed manually by running run_rrc_bot.sh
# or monit restart cms-rrc-bot on host.
# 
# sudo apt get install monit
# Install this file in /etc/monit/conf-enabled
# monit reload
# Bot should now be running
